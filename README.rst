Edited by taking copy from `tkurtbond/old-ada-mode`_
and correcting for deprecated functions for newer emacs.
The corrections done was with help of Claude.

.. _tkurtbond/old-ada-mode: https://github.com/tkurtbond/old-ada-mode

Add following in your emacs init file

.. code:: emacs-lisp
	  
	(add-to-list 'load-path "path-to-ada-mode")
	(require 'ada-mode)
